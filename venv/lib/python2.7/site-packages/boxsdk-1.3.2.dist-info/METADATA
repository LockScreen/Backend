            :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boxsdk
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            pip install boxsdk
        
        
        Authorization
        -------------
        
        The Box API uses OAuth2 for auth. The SDK makes it relatively painless
        to work with OAuth2 tokens.
        
        Get the authorization url
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from boxsdk import OAuth2
        
            oauth = OAuth2(
                client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
                client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
                store_tokens=your_store_tokens_callback_method,
            )
        
            auth_url, csrf_token = oauth.get_authorization_url('http://YOUR_REDIRECT_URL')
        
        store_tokens is a callback used to store the access token and refresh
        token. You might want to define something like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            def store_tokens(access_token, refresh_token):
                # store the tokens at secure storage (e.g. Keychain)
        
        The SDK will keep the tokens in memory for the duration of the Python
        script run, so you don't always need to pass store_tokens.
        
        Authenticate (get access/refresh token)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you navigate the user to the auth_url, the user will eventually get
        redirected to http://YOUR_REDIRECT_URL?code=YOUR_AUTH_CODE.  After
        getting the code, you will be able to use the code to exchange for
        access token and fresh token.
        
        The SDK handles all the work for you; all you need to do is run:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Make sure that the csrf token you get from the `state` parameter
            # in the final redirect URI is the same token you get from the
            # get_authorization_url method.
            assert 'THE_CSRF_TOKEN_YOU_GOT' == csrf_token
            access_token, refresh_token = oauth.authenticate('YOUR_AUTH_CODE')
        
        Create an authenticated client
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from boxsdk import Client
        
            client = Client(oauth)
        
        And that's it! You can start using the client to do all kinds of cool stuff
        and the SDK will handle the token refresh for you automatically.

        Move an item
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            client.file(file_id='SOME_FILE_ID').move(client.folder(folder_id='SOME_FOLDER_ID'))
        
        Get content of a file
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            client.file(file_id='SOME_FILE_ID').content()
        
        Lock/unlock a file
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            client.file(file_id='SOME_FILE_ID').lock()
            client.file(file_id='SOME_FILE_ID').unlock()
        
        Search
        ~~~~~~
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            client.search('some_query', limit=100, offset=0)
        
        Events
        ~~~~~~
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Get events
            client.events().get_events(limit=100, stream_position='now')
        
            # Generate events using long polling
            for event in client.events().generate_events_with_long_polling():
                pass  # Do something with the event
        
            # Get latest stream position
            client.events().get_latest_stream_position()
        
        Metadata
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Get metadata
            client.file(file_id='SOME_FILE_ID').metadata().get()
        
            # Create metadata
            client.file(file_id='SOME_FILE_ID').metadata().create({'key': 'value'})
        
            # Update metadata
            metadata = client.file(file_id='SOME_FILE_ID').metadata()
            update = metadata.start_update()
            update.add('/key', 'new_value')
            metadata.update(update)
        
        As-User
        ~~~~~~~
        
        The `Client` class and all Box objects also have an `as_user` method.
        
        `as-user` returns a copy of the object on which it was called that will make Box API requests
        as though the specified user was making it.
        
        See https://box-content.readme.io/#as-user-1 for more information about how this works via the Box API.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Logged in as admin, but rename a file as SOME USER
            user = client.user(user_id='SOME_USER_ID')
            client.as_user(user).file(file_id='SOME_FILE_ID').rename('bar-2.txt')
        
        
            # Same thing, but using file's as_user method
            client.file(file_id='SOME_FILE_ID').as_user(user).rename('bar-2.txt')
        
        
        Box Developer Edition
        ---------------------
        
        The Python SDK supports your
        `Box Developer Edition <https://developers.box.com/developer-edition/>`__ applications.
        
        Developer Edition support requires some extra dependencies. To get them, simply
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            pip install boxsdk[jwt]
        
        Instead of instantiating your `Client` with an instance of `OAuth2`,
        instead use an instance of `JWTAuth`.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from boxsdk import JWTAuth
        
            auth = JWTAuth(
                client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
                client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
                enterprise_id='YOUR_ENTERPRISE_ID',
                rsa_private_key_file_sys_path='CERT.PEM',
                store_tokens=your_store_tokens_callback_method,
            )
        
            access_token = auth.authenticate_instance()
        
            from boxsdk import Client
        
            client = Client(auth)
        
        This client is able to create application users:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            ned_stark_user = client.create_user('Ned Stark')
        
        These users can then be authenticated:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            ned_auth = JWTAuth(
               client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
               client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
               enterprise_id='YOUR_ENTERPRISE_ID',
               rsa_private_key_file_sys_path='CERT.PEM',
               store_tokens=your_store_tokens_callback_method,
           )
           ned_auth.authenticate_app_user(ned_stark_user)
           ned_client = Client(ned_auth)
        
        Requests made with `ned_client` (or objects returned from `ned_client`'s methods)
        will be performed on behalf of the newly created app user.
        
        Other Auth Options
        ------------------
        
        For advanced uses of the SDK, two additional auth classes are provided:
        
        - `CooperativelyManagedOAuth2`: Allows multiple auth instances to share tokens.
        - `RemoteOAuth2`: Allows use of the SDK on clients without access to your application's client secret. Instead, you
          provide a `retrieve_access_token` callback. That callback should perform the token refresh, perhaps on your server
          that does have access to the client secret.
        - `RedisManagedOAuth2`: Stores access and refresh tokens in Redis. This allows multiple processes (possibly spanning
          multiple machines) to share access tokens while synchronizing token refresh. This could be useful for a multiprocess
          web server, for example.
        
        Other Network Options
        ---------------------
        
        For more insight into the network calls the SDK is making, you can use the `LoggingNetwork` class. This class logs
        information about network requests and responses made to the Box API.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from boxsdk import Client
            from boxsdk.network.logging_network import LoggingNetwork
        
            client = Client(oauth, network_layer=LoggingNetwork())

        Developer Setup
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Create a virtual environment and install packages -
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            mkvirtualenv boxsdk
            pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
        
        
        Testing
        ~~~~~~~
        
        Run all tests using -
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            tox
        
        The tox tests include code style checks via pep8 and pylint.
